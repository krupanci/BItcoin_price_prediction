# BItcoin_price_prediction
<h1>Problem statement</h1>
Predicting the price of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin is a complex task due to their highly volatile and non-linear nature. 
This project aims to build a real-time Bitcoin price prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks â€” a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) well-suited for time series forecasting. By using daily historical Bitcoin data, the model learns patterns and trends to make accurate future price predictions.
